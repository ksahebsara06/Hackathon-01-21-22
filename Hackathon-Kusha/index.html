	<p>
		In Physical Sciences, Mechanical Energy is the <span id="sum">SUM of Potential and Kinetic energy</span> within a closed system.
	</p>
	
	<h2>
	<span id="mis"> Misconceptions </span>
	</h2>
	<p>
		In exams, this concept is often tested on because the <span id="law">Law of Conservation of Energy</span> is used frequently in calculations found in energy calculations. Common errors include taking the difference between the potential and kinetic energy in the system instead of the summation.
